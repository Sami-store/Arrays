Create a Java application named "ArrayCalculations" that performs calculations on a two-dimensional array of doubles. The program will consist of the following components:

    Two-Dimensional Array Declaration:
        Declare a two-dimensional array named scores with 6 rows and 2 columns.

    Input Method:
        Implement a method that utilizes a nested while loop to gather 12 doubles (6 x 2) from the user via a Scanner object.
        This method will return the populated 2D array of doubles.

    Average Calculation Method:
        Create a method that uses a nested for loop to compute the average of the doubles in each row of the scores array.
        This method will accept the 2D array as an argument and return a 1D array of doubles containing the average of each row.

    Output Method:
        Develop a method to display the averages of the six rows on the screen.
        This method will accept the 1D array of averages as an argument.

Program Flow

    The main method will call these methods in sequence to collect user input, calculate averages, and display the results.
